News Flash: People have been acting weird all over Brentville
lately. I was talking to my boss the other day, and I casually
asked him what shake he was drinking. It looked delicious! He
said, I’m drinking a mud slide shake. Want some? I drank it and it
tasted sweet. Definitely not what mud tastes like. Also, y’all
should try out the new green spinach veggie patty! It tastes so
good. That’s what my boss said. burger ad You turn off the TV.
Doesn’t seem that interesting anyways. Also, who cares if her boss
was lying? You decide you want to get out of the house.
