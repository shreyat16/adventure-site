title: Talk to him

Hey dude! What are you doing with all that spinach? Save some for everyone else!

“Umm… hi?” the strange man responds with an oddly high pitched voice. I’m just trying out this new homemade recipe to sell at my store, and boy oh boy does it require oodles and oodles of spinach!

“Interesting! What’s the recipe?” you ask. 

“Well, I’ve been trying to make alternative versions of fast food. To reduce heartburn. I’m a scientist.”

“Cool! What’s your name?” you ask. “I’m Dr. Fred. Nice to meet you!” 

“Nice to meet you too. It was nice talking to you sir, but I have to get going. I’m going to meet up with my girlfriend later.”

“Okay, kid! You have fun!” Dr. Fred says as he walks away. 

You came to the store so you should probably grab some sustenance.
