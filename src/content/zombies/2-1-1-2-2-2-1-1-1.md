title: Make antidote

You start up the blender and make 5 gallons of antidote. 

Now that you both have the cure, you need to figure out how to give it to the zombies. You and Dr. Fred come up with two options. 

1.Throw the antidote at them and let the juices get absorbed into their skin.

2.Turn the antidote into fumes so that they can inhale it.
