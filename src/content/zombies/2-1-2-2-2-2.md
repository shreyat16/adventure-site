title: Let him in
---

You decide to let him in. Life is all about taking chances, right? You open the door cautiously and start talking to him. 

“Hi Dr. Fred. Everything alright?” you ask cautiously. 

“Hey! Thanks for opening up the door! I’ve been trying all night to get a hold of somebody to help but no one is opening up their doors anymore! They’re all scared of the zombie apocalypse.” 

He sounds genuine, so you let him in.
