title: Throw the antidote at them
isWinner: false

You add the antidote into water guns and sneakily step out of the house, using the back door. You see a zombie and spray it with the water gun! 

But wait! It didn’t work… the antidote drips off the zombie’s skin and it keeps walking towards you. You try to run but your foot is caught in the leafy hands of another zombie. 

You lost. You turned into a lying zombie.
