title: Meet up with your girlfriend
---
Meet up with your girlfriend. You call her and tell her to
meet you at the park. You see her and hug her. She tells you that
she’s scared about the lying people around town. You tell her it’s
probably a thing that the adults are doing to be like the young cool
kids. "Want to get some food?" you ask. She says yeah. You go to the
restaurant. She orders a burger with a veggie patty because she’s
trying a new diet.
