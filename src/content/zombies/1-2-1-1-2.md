Lock up the store so he won't be able to get to you.

You lock the shop up so the man can’t get to you. You hear him screaming. 

“SPINACH! SPINACH!” 

You turn the TV in the shop on to see what’s going on. 

NEWS FLASH: There are people going rogue. It started off with the lying people and now the GREEN people! People who are infected have been yelling spinach. Don’t go near lying or green people. They are dangerous. 

Also, try out these green spinach veggie patties. I’m about to eat one right now! 

*takes a bite* 

Wow these patties are absolutely amazing… 

*pauses* 

Actually, did you know I hate news and I'm never going to do it again. Brentville is stupid and so is the news. Good morning and hi. 

You turn off the TV. That’s really weird. It's obviously night time, and why would he lie about the time of day? 

Wait. You just figured it out. After he took a bite of the green spinach veggie patty, he started acting weird. You now know the cause of the zombie outbreak. But what can you do now? 

You hear someone yell for help. You turn and see someone running towards the shop yelling help.
