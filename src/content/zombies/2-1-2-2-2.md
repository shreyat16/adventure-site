title: Go home. It's been a long day.
---

You end up going home because you feel like you need some time alone. 

You turn on the tv, and hear a scratching sound coming from outside. You go to the door to investigate. Who could it be? You peek through the doorhole and see a strange man knocking on the door. 

It looks like the same man from the supermarket earlier, Dr Fred! He says he has the cure to the zombie outbreak! 

What should you do?
