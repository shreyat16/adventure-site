Go to the store

You get in your car and start backing up. Behind you, you hear your neighbors yelling at each other. “Why did
you not tell me that you lost your job?!” Susan yells at her husband,
Matt. “I didn’t lose my job!” Matt croaks back. That’s weird. You and
Matt used to work at the same shake place. He got fired the other day
for lying about stealing from the tip jar, even though I saw him
sneaking money from it during breaks! Why was he lying again? This was
not a good week for him. You back out and head to the store. At Hole
Foods, you run into a strange man in the vegetable aisle. This man is
piling packets and packets of spinach in his cart. He’s wearing a
black oversized hoodie and has the hoodie pulled up so that shadows
are falling on his face. Strange… who needs that much spinach?
