title: Get a hotdog, spinach is gross!
---

You both get your food and start eating. You finish eating and it’s time to pay the bill. It’s your girlfriend’s turn to pay. The waiter comes and asks for a card. 

“Kelly give him your card.” 

“No, I don't have my card. I guess you’re paying.” 

That’s weird. You can see her card in her phone case holder. You pay anyway because you think she’s messing with you. After you leave the restaurant, you ask her if she's doing okay. She tells you that she’s a broke college girl. You know for a fact that she won the lottery last month. Your girlfriend is acting weird with you and you don’t know what to do.
