Yet them in, they could help you try and find an antidote.

You go closer to the window and see a man with a science coat on. He doesn't look like a zombie because he doesn't look green at all. You unlock the doors and let him in. He looks like he’s been running so you made your favorite drink for him which is the spinach, kale, and blueberry shake. He gulps it down quickly and starts to talk.

“My name is Dr. Fred and I need help. I’m the one who created the green spinach veggie patty. It was great at first. It practically made me rich! It was great until people started eating it. I realized there was something wrong in the artificial meat’s chemical bonds. A spinach bond mutated and poisoned the patty. Anyone who eats it will lie for 24 hours and then turn green like the man outside. You and I are probably one of the few people left. I need you to help me make an antidote.”

“Ok that's a lot to take in. I want to help you because now I know that my girlfriend ate one and I want to save her. What do we need to do?” you ask.

“I made a recipe. Here you go.”
