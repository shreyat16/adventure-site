title: Oranges, spinach, donuts, and frozen bacon

You grab your food, pay for it, and call your girlfriend and tell her to meet you at the park. 

At the park, you see her walking towards you and hug her. You sit down and she tells you that she’s scared about the lying people around town. You tell her it’s probably a thing that the adults are doing to be like the young kids, and to not worry about it.

Your stomach starts grumbling. "Want to get some food?" you ask. She says sure. 

You go to the nearest restaurant. It's a fast food place, but they've started selling these new veggie burgers and so you know your girl will have something to eat. She orders the veggie burger because she’s trying a new diet.
